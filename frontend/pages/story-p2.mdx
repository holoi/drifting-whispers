<h2 id='howitworks'>How It Works</h2>

<h3>Essence</h3>
Essence is the user's AI Agent, but it is a localized AI Agent, geospecial, based on nomadic notes left by the user in a particular space and time, a snapshot of the nomad's memory. The user can capture a copy of their essence before leaving any place.

<h3>Embodiment</h3>
Embodied Perception: Our perceptual experience is based on our body and our body's interaction with the environment, perception determines reality. AR technology is one of the core technological strengths of the Wafting Whispers team, allowing embodied perception determines that Wafting Whispers' reality is an interactive, liveable (not virtual) reality. Embodiment liberates "prisoners" of a carefully curated digital "hyperreality".

<h3>Encounter</h3>
Wafting Whispers simulate natural encounters, and Essence will be captured as it passes by any user as it drifts over the city in response to real wind and air currents. Essence stops when the wind is low, and if it remains uncaptured for too long, it forms a "temporal amber" that freezes and stops drifting until it is found again. Unlike other social apps, Wafting Whispers' spatial socialization relies heavily on the will of nature. Discovering each other is an "Eureka" process, and non intent based space socialization is the most humanistic way to socialize.

<h3>Embodied Perception of an Encounter</h3>

The first wind of the morning blows and you awaken in Istanbul with your cell phone by your pillow. You open Wafting Whispers on your phone, and through the AR camera, you see that an Essence (a local embodiment of a nomad) is drifting towards your window, in the direction of the wind. You put your hand out the window and grab her, gesturing as if you were trying to catch a firefly. The aperture grows larger in your hand; it is a girl who was also traveling in Istanbul three months ago. You strike up a conversation with her, making small talk and learning that she had found a dress exactly like the one she was wearing at the Museum of Innocence. Naturally, you next talk about another of Pamuk's novels, My Name is Red (you're surprised that you read the same book before coming to Turkey!) ). Her next stop is Budapest, and just last week she left Istanbul. Your on-chain addresses documented this wonderful conversation.

<h3>Create an Istanbul Version of yourself...*</h3>

In many streets of Istanbul, there are still many such Essence hidden. where the wind lives, there exists the Essence of the nomad. So, you step out of your B&B and roam around the Ä°stiklal Avenue. Before dusk falls, you go to the beach and decide to create an Essence of your own before you leave the place.After recording, you blow into your cell phone and your Essence flies towards the harbor, where it will follow the winds of the Bosphorus Strait and continue to float around Istanbul, waiting for the next encounter.

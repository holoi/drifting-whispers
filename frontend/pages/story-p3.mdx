<h2>Spatial Social Network</h2>

The structure of Wafting Whispers is that of a spatial social network*. In the age of spatial computing, the boundaries between the real and the virtual will be increasingly shaken, and spatial social networks are the social networks of the future. Compared with on-screen social networks, spatialized social networks emphasize a sense of presence:

<h3>Presence of the Self</h3>
Nomadism requires antifragility. The presence of the "self" is a proof of the robustness of the individual's relationship with space, and it answers the question of the relationship between man and space. The human being is not a visitor to space, but a "plant" of space, which needs to grow in space and discover the roots of its existence. What are the forms of our presence? Multimedia such as cameras, audio recordings or writing provide various imitations of presence, but the most complete presence is the presence of the Agent. Based on this, the User Essence (AI Agent) guarantees the presence of the self. It is a deeply interactive inscription of space: once present, always present.

<h3>Presence of others</h3>
The presence of the self cannot constitute complete freedom; freedom exists in intersubjectivity. We are interdependent beings, and the ultimate purpose of Essence is to create the conditions for communication when communication is not possible.Wafting Whispers allows different Essences (with different real people behind them) to achieve async copresence, a local time machine; through agent as media, the presence of others across time and space is confirmed in both directions.

<h3>Presence of the community</h3>
The presence of the self and the presence of the other ultimately lead to the presence of the community. On the basis of these two points, we form a Spatial Nomad Social Network, where those who enter the AR world of Wafting Whispers see two different worlds from those who do not: the latter are somehow "nomadically deaf", unable to hear those who come from history and from others. In this way, Wafting Whispers will create a field of community that will be open to all nomads. The diaspora is the territory.

<h3>Autonomous World</h3>
Space is the greatest public good. In the real world, most spaces have their own names; Wafting Whispers' AR technology creates a new spatial layer, a permissionless space, forming a permissionless reality. In this new "reality", each Essence (user identity) is a fully autonomous entity backed by an on-chain entity (e.g., an ENS address or Lens address, etc.) that can upload on-chain data to refine its Essence profile.

This is an AW space built on top of a real urban space, and the basic components of this world are the Essences, the Whispers between them, the relationships between Essences, and the movement trajectories of Essences.

<h2>Digital Physics: The Will of Nature Brought Us Together</h2>

Nature is truly random. It's hard to find an unpredictable positive social action outside of a systematized social system, and the Wafting Whispers encounter system dictates that every person you meet is the will of nature, and that "capture" is just the last step at the end of the will of nature. Each encounter is unique, unrepeatable, irreplaceable and, accordingly, a form of serendipity.

We have chosen the natural wind as the first driving force. The real world is highly artificial, in the virtual world it is back to the real nature. It's a Digitalized Nature, and we've talked a lot about presence. Ultimately, we want nature to be present in this new world.

<h3>Eternal Localness</h3>

The history of all the people in the city is the best history of the city: looking at Wafting Whispers not from a nomad-centric point of view, but from the point of view of the city itself, we can see that Wafting Whispers retains the impression of the most everyday life of a city. It essentially constitutes the cultural memory of a city. The advancement of media has also deepened our understanding of localness, which is not only spatially local, such as the difference between one city and another, but also temporally local, as Istanbul in the 1980s is different from Istanbul in the 2020s, but in a longer time scale localness is more temporally differentiated. In a longer time scale, localness has a temporal differentiation. By capturing an essence, we permanently keep the localness of a city on the chain.

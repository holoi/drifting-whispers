Oh, Istanbul has been incredible! Coming here for ETHGlobal adds such a unique vibe to the trip. I'm surrounded by history, yet here we are, talking about the future of technology. It's like being part of a grand continuum, you know? It feels really special to contribute to this ongoing narrative with something as innovative as blockchain. Makes me wonder what the next chapter will be like!
